Hi friends, here is a brief description of how this dApp works.
deREG is a dApp coded in RIDE (Smart contract programming language on Waves blockchain), it is used to manage birth record. The dApp is able to save, update and retrieve birth records.

###### There 3 user levels on the dApp:
1. First Level User: This is the principal dApp account and access to deploy the smart contract on the blockchain. This user holds the private key of the account that is used to deploy the dApp. This account can add, update, search and print records on the dApp.
Example of this user level in real life is NIMC.

2. Second Level User: This refers to middle layer users whose accounts are first authorized and endorsed by First Level User before they can add, update, search and print records on the dApp. Example of this user level in real life is Hospitals.

3. Third Level Users: These are the end users whose records are added, searched, updated and printed on the dApp.
